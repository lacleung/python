# Pong

Pong game adapted from the first tutorial found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGf2GcyHPhc). This is my attempt to transform the basic code explained from the tutorial to a more object based approach with added features.

## Added Features
- Reduced code verbosity by created object classes for paddles and balls
- Added arbitrary difficultly level by adding multiple balls
- Created variability in ball speed and direction
- Added random qualitiy of life improvements like preventing paddles from moving offscreen
