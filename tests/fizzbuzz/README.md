# FizzBuzz

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz): "Fizz buzz (often spelled FizzBuzz in this context) has been used as an interview screening device for computer programmers. Writing a program to output the first 100 FizzBuzz numbers is a relatively trivial problem requiring little more than a loop and conditional statements. However, its value in coding interviews is to analyze fundamental coding habits that may be indicative of overall coding ingenuity."

Although there are various of this challenge, this particular solution takes a sequence of numbers and prints `fizz` for every number divisible by `3` and `buzz` for every number divisible by `5` and `fizzbuzz` for any number divisible by both.
