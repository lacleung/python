## Areas of Improvement and Additional Info
- I took the full 2 hours to do this challenge (+ a bit more for personal research)
- Add more detailed comments
- Create input data validation steps 
- Create more error checking for invalid inputs or unexpected outputs 
- Create status messages where relevant
- Write more automated unit test 
  - I created manual tests with various odd inputs while coding and other input.txt files (e.g. Names with more words/symbols, scores with more digits etc.)
- Find faster ways to sort scoreboard
- Write a more detailed readme/instructions and condense the necessary dependecies to run the script
- Learn python more!
